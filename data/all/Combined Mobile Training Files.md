# Browse Screens
Browse screens, or Lists, use tiles or cards to represent individual records in the database. Each card displays the Id, Name, Description or other pertinent data necessary to select a record to view in more detail.

Use swipe gestures to scroll through the records.

Browse screens are usually sorted by record Id in ascending order.
![browse.png](/.attachments/browse-c8ffafe2-97d4-476b-868c-2457eab7b612.png)

# Detail Screen tabs
Detail screens group related information together under named Tabs.  A Detail screen identifies the record being displayed as part of the screen title and this is visible regardless of which Tab is selected.

To see additional Tabs use a swipe horizontally across the Tabs.
![Detail Screen tabs.png](/.attachments/Detail%20Screen%20tabs-d97662f0-31d4-428f-9e77-b5b52e2b7775.png)

# Date Selection Column
Date input columns are seen on the  Work Request Add page. These columns default to the current date. Each month, day, year segment of the date is associated with a scrollable selection list.

# Hyperlinks
Hyperlinks to phone numbers, email addresses, and web pages will open the default App on the device for those items.

- [Test Plan: Notify on Rejection](/CHAMPS/Mobile-Maintenance-App/Inbox/Items-Sent-for-Approval/Reject/Test-Plan:-Notify-on-Rejection)

# Description
If a user approves a document but does not have a high enough spending limit to cover the total cost of the document, the user is not allowed to approve it.

### Test Plan

During this, if a PO is sent to Sam, it will show up in your Intray and INBOX. You will be able to approve up to Sam's $10,000 limit for items sent to him. If an item is sent to you directly, you will still only have your $5,000 limit.
