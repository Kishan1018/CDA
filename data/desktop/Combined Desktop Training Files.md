<div style='text-align: justify; padding:20px'>
Accounts Payable is a cash management and disbursement system that is fully integrated
with purchase orders, inventory control, and general ledger. The Accounts Payable module
streamlines the flow and processing of data by providing on-line approvals, pre-defined
expense distributions, and invoice allocations.
<br><br>
Accounts Payable provides flexible payment processing and detailed disbursement
information allowing the company to successfully control vendor relationships while
managing cash flow and controlling expenses. 
<br><br>
Accounts Payable supports complete vendor
payment history and invoice analysis with user-defined aging ranges. Accounts Payable
also supports unlimited alternate addresses, 1099 processing, sales and use tax
calculations including VAT and GST, on-line approval of vendors and invoices, unlimited
freeform text and multiple payment options including checks, wire transfers and electronic
funds transfers.
<br><br>
The following list describes the features available to you in Accounts
Payable:
<br><br>

**- Unlimited Vendor Addresses:** You can define an unlimited number of alternate vendor
addresses to accommodate business having multiple locations.

**- User-Defined Vendor Categories:** Vendor categories can be defined in any way you
choose; for example, you can set them up and use them to group contractors,
employees, and general vendors for purposes of analysis.

**- Vendor Default Account Numbers:** You can set up default accounts payable and
expense accounts while you are entering invoices. You can always override the defaults
you set up.

**- 1099 and Backup Withholding:** You can use Accounts Payable to track and report 1099
expenditures in compliance with federal and state reporting requirements.

**- Full Multi-Currency Support:** You can enter invoices and payments in the vendor's
currency, and Accounts Payable automatically converts the transaction to your base
currency for general ledger purposes. Both currency values display on invoices and
payments.

**- Extensive Defaulting of Data:** You can set up a variety of vendor invoicing information
(e.g., payment terms, addresses, GL distribution accounts) to automatically default while
you are entering invoices.

**- Recurring Vouchers:** Accounts Payable supports the creation of weekly, bi-monthly,
monthly, and quarterly recurring vouchers.

**- Payment Controls:** You can specify whether to pay invoices based on due date,
discount date, priority, category, payment type, group, vendor, or any combination of
criteria.

**- Unlimited Bank Accounts:** Accounts Payable supports an unlimited number of bank
accounts and allows you to pre-define each bank’s cash account.

**- Vendor and Invoice Hold Processing:** You can place vendors and invoices on hold to
prevent processing of purchase order requisitions and POs and Accounts Payable
invoices and payments.


**- Sales and Use Tax Calculations:** You can set up sales and use tax codes, including
VAT (Value Added Tax) and GST (Goods and Services Tax), to automatically calculate
tax expenses and accrual amounts.

**- Automatic Creation of Distributions:** You can set up commonly used general ledger
distributions to use during invoice entry to automatically allocate the expense to the
distribution.

**- Bank Reconciliation:** Accounts Payable supports full bank reconciliation including
deposits, disbursements, and adjustments.

**- Automatic Duplicate Invoice Checking:** Accounts Payable automatically tests for
duplicate invoices to prevent unauthorized payments.

**- Standard Reports:** Includes a variety of reports, such as cash flow requirements,

<div style='text-align: justify; padding:20px'>

Once a SKU has been setup, Inventory can be added, issued, returned, transferred, reserved,
physical inventoried, and re-ordered.  When the Inventory
record is added the increase in inventory will be documented as a **'Beginning Balance'** type
Movement History record.

From this point, any transaction that affects Inventory
on-hand quantity or value will generate a Movement History record.

<div style='border-left: 10px solid #1E90FF; padding:10px; background-color: #707070'>

 <br><b> Note: You can access field definitions [here](/CMMS-User's-Guide/Inventory-\(INV\)/Inventory-Management/Inventory-%2D-Field-Definitions) </b>
</div>

# Prerequisite
To add inventory, you should have the [SKU Setup](/CMMS-User's-Guide/Inventory-\(INV\)/SKU/Add-New-SKU) and approved.

# Add Inventory
- From the **Main Menu**-> Choose **Inventory** -> Click **Part List** -> Click the '**Inventory**' tab and Click **'New'** (Inventory tab will not be accessible if it is Non-Inventoried SKU) 
  - Alternatively, you can access inventory from  **Main Menu**-> Choose **Inventory** -> Click **'New'** 
- This will open new page to add inventory information
- Select the **'SKU'** from the list if it is not loaded by default (If your SKU is not listed, make sure your SKU is configured as '**_Inventoried_**' and '**_Approved_**')
- Select the warehouse '**Location**' from the list
- Use **'Active'** checkbox to indicate whether the Inventory record is active or inactive.
- Select '**Default Bin**' within the current warehouse location. This can be changed later from the [Bin Tab](/CMMS-User's-Guide/Inventory-\(INV\)/Inventory-Management/Change-Default-Bin)
- Select the '**Cycle Code**' which is used to segregate Inventory items (SKUs) into groups that facilitate the
physical counting process.
- Enter the '**Quantity on hand**' for this warehouse Location in all Bins. This is editable only during 'Add' and quantity entered here will be the **_Beginning Balance._**
- Enter '**Standard Cost**'
- Check '**Approved**' to make this inventory accessible across all the other components
- Click '**Save**'

On successful submission, you will be redirected to '**Inventory Edit**' window. 
The Inventory Edit window has three tabs: _Inventory, Bin Quantities and Serial/Lot_. SKUs that were setup to be serialized (assigned a serial number) can be tracked using the
Serial/Lot tab. 
>> Cycle code must be populated before you can begin your Physical Inventory counts. Cycle codes are used to divide a warehouse into subsets to simplify Physical Inventory and cycle counts.
#Bin Quantities Tab
The Bin Quantities tab on the Inventory window shows the current Inventory levels of the
SKU at each bin within an Inventory location. You cannot make modifications in the Bin
Quantities tab
#Serial / Lot Tab
The Inventory window’s Serial/Lot is only enabled if the SKU has been identified as being
Lot controlled or Serialized. From the Serial/Lot Tab you can:
Click the Asset Tag and Shelf Life columns to enter information for this Inventoried SKU.
Extend the Shelf Life Date of an item.

A SKU (Stock Keeping Unit) record identifies and describes the physical properties and
business logic applied to an item. A SKU is required in all other Inventory and Purchasing
transaction. SKUs can be created to define physical items to be stored as warehouse
inventory. Non-Inventoried goods and services are also defined as SKUs.

All purchasing activities require SKU codes defined as Miscellaneous, Inventoried or
Receivable. For example, you may setup a SKU to record shipping and freight charges.
Since units are not associated with these charges, you do not need to track freight as an
inventoried item therefore you would set up a miscellaneous SKU for freight

<center><h1>Work Order Task Completion</h1></center>

Work order task can be set to complete in any one of the two methods,

1. **Individual Completion** - Work Order tasks can be completed individually using the **Work Order task Edit window**’s 
[Completion](/CMMS-User's-Guide/Work-Order-\(WO\)/Work-Order-Task--\(WOT\)/Work-Order-Task-\(WOT\)-%2D-Field-Definitions/WOT-%2D-Completion-Tab) tab. 
1. **Bulk Completion** - The 'Work Order Task Completion' page allows multiple tasks to be completed at 
the same time. 
<br></br>
# Completion Terms
- WO Task Completion uses Workflow setup to determine those tasks 
currently in a Prior State to Complete. These tasks are considered eligible to complete
- Non-complete Mandatory Action Codes prevent the Completion process. 
- WO task completion sets the completion percentage to 100, Date Completed
to the system date, and populates the Completed By with the last name, first name of the
associated User id for the selected task.
- Based on the Workflow setup, completing the Work Order’s last open Work Order Task will
also complete the Work Order.
- Once all the WO Tasks are completed, WO can be closed.

#Individual Completion

- From the **Main Menu**-> Choose **Maintenance** -> **Work Order List**
- Use the filter to find the WO you are intended to perform this operation
- Go to **'Associated Task'** Tab and Click on the **'Edit'** icon next to task you may want to modify
- **'WO ID'** is displayed as entered on the WO Header tab
- Go to the **'Completion'** tab
- Make sure all the mandatory action codes are 'complete'. Any work order task with <i>**non-complete action codes that are mandatory** </i>cannot be set to **'Complete'**. If this step is not completed, you cannot successfully perform the following steps to set the WO Task to complete
  - [Click here](/CMMS-User's-Guide/Work-Order-\(WO\)/Work-Order-Task--\(WOT\)/Work-Order-Task-\(WOT\)-%2D-Functions/Manage-Action-Codes) for the steps to set action codes to **'complete'**.

# Define Next Number Format
The Format is used to generate a **new ID** when a document of this type is created. The following list of place holders may be used when constructing the format:

- @ - a digit place holder filled by the current value of the starting number-padded by leading zeros
- `HIE` - Represents Signed in users location.
- `dd` - Represents the day of the month as a number from 01 through 31.
- `ddd` - Represents the abbreviated name of the day (Mon, Tues, Wed, ect).
- `dddd` - Represents the full name of the day (Monday, Tuesday, ect).
- `MM` - Month number with leading zero(eg.04)

#Enable Auto ID
- Log on to CMMS as a user with system administration rights.
- Choose <b>'Administration'</b> from the bottom menu -> <b>Work Flow</b> -> <b>WF document type</b>
- This will automatically redirect you to WF document type's browse page
- Use <b>'ID'</b> filter to select <b>'Purchase Request'</b>
- Click <b>'Edit'</b> icon
- Check 'Auto Number ID' ![image.png](/.attachments/image-3baefd7f-9849-4b22-9790-38f808448a05.png =100x) to enable automatic generation of purchase Request ID

- Choose <b>'Organization'</b> from the list. 
- Note that Organization is an optional field. if organization is not selected, the format will be applicable to all the organizations. If you select the organization, the defined format will be applicable to only selected organization
- Enter <b>'Starting Number'</b>. By default, it is 0. The value in this field is actually the last number used, and the next instance of the number will use that number incremented by one. For example, to start POs at 1001, you would enter 1000
- Click <b>'Save'</b>

# Define Next Number Format
The Format is used to generate a **new ID** when a document of this type is created. The following list of place holders may be used when constructing the format:

- @ - a digit place holder filled by the current value of the starting number-padded by leading zeros
- `HIE` - Represents Signed in users location.
- `dd` - Represents the day of the month as a number from 01 through 31.
- `ddd` - Represents the abbreviated name of the day (Mon, Tues, Wed, ect).
- `dddd` - Represents the full name of the day (Monday, Tuesday, ect).
- `MM` - Month number with leading zero(eg.04)
- `MMM` - Abbreviated Month Name (eg.Dec)
- `MMMM` - Full month name (eg.December)
- `yy` - Year, leading zero (eg. 2015 would be 015)
- `yyyy` - Year, (eg. 2015)


<br>For Example, the format **PR-`HIE`-`yyyy`-`MM`-@@@@@** autogenerates ID **PR-Warehouse A-2022-01-00001** <br><br>

plus the Frequency when the related Work Order is completed.

**Surveillance Task:** Next Due Date is initially derived from the current
Next Due Date plus the Frequency when the PM is generated into a Work
Order. If the related Work Order is completed later than the Next Due
Date, the PM Next Due Date remains as-is. If the related Work Order is
completed before the Next Due Date, the PM Next Due Date is
recalculated using the Work Order Completion Date.

<center> <h1>Differential Code Field Definitions</h1></center>
<div style= 'text-align: justify; padding:10px'>

Differential Codes are used to define a premium, which may be added to a worker’s hourly rate, or a multiplier that may be used to adjust the worker’s normal hourly rate. For example, a Differential Code defined for ‘night shift’ may be associated with a .25 cents premium.

<br></br>


Differential codes may be associated with a Premium value that is added to the hourly rate to be charged for a particular employee. The Premium is used in the following formula:
Base Labor Rate + Differential Premium = Adjusted Total Labor Rate

For Example: An employee normally working the day shift is asked to work second shift for one week. A $.50 cents Premium has been defined for second shift work. The employee’s normal pay-rate is $10.00/hr. and a 40 hour week has been worked. Total labor charge for the employee is as follows.
40 regular hrs x $10.50 ($10/hr + $.50 Premium = $10.50/hr) = $420.00

Differential Multiplier
Differential codes may be associated with a Multiplier value that is used to calculate the total hourly rate to be charged for a particular employee. The Differential Multiplier is used in the following formula:
Base Labor Rate x Multiplier = Adjusted Total Labor Rate

For Example: An employee works 40 regular hours + 8 hours overtime in a hazardous area for which a Differential Multiplier of 1.5 has been defined. (The employees base pay rate = $10.00 and the overtime rate is “time-and-a-half”.) Total labor charge for the employee would be calculated as follows:

40 hrs x $10.00/hr = $400.00
12 hrs (8 hrs x 1.5 OT Multiplier) x +180.00
$15.00/hr ($10.00 pay-rate x 1.5 differential Multiplier = $580.00

<div style= 'text-align: justify; padding:10px'>
Association Code allows multiple Association Codes to be related
with an equipment record. An equipment record may share many of the same Association
Codes with other equipment.<br><br>

This feature is designed to allow dissimilar equipment, operating on different systems, and in
different parent/child hierarchies to be related to one another. When one equipment is shut
down for maintenance, other equipment related by Association Code may be found and
repaired at the same time.
When related equipment have been found, it may be appropriate to schedule/perform their
related Work Orders and generate PMs during the current ‘window of opportunity’. <br><br>

Generally, the work request is reviewed by a maintenance manager, who adds extra information, Procedure, schedules the task, approve to assigns it to a technician as Work Order. A work request can be modeled to work order only once to avoid generating multiple work order for the same problem.
<br><Br>
Model WO  is disabled if,
- The work request has no Asset ID selected
- WR is already modeled to WO atleast once

#Procedure

- From the **Main Menu**-> Choose **Maintenance** -> **WR List**
- Use the filter to find the WR you are intended to model
- Click on the **'WR ID'** to open WR specific information
- Make sure, the Work Request has Asset ID selected. Work Request without Asset ID cannot be converted into Work Order by modeling.
- Click on the **'Model WO'** button from the top menu.

 - A new window will pop requesting to select Work Order **'Job Type'**
   - Selecting a **'Job Type'** from the list below will set the New Work Order's Job Type. If there are any Default **'Trades'** for this Job Type the Work Order Task will be populated with these values <br>![MOdel WO Job TYpe.png](/.attachments/MOdel%20WO%20Job%20TYpe-693c8521-eb2b-410d-99d6-fb47dbc21885.png)
- Click **'Model'** to model WO

- On Successful WO creation, the popup will display with the newly generated **'WO ID'** <br>![WO created.png](/.attachments/WO%20created-c0692a2b-5209-4d13-940a-fcf562983c99.png)
- You can either click on the ID to access the **'Newly Modeled WO'** or navigate to **Maintenance -> Work Order List** to access the new WO generated or close to exit the popup

</div>

#Prerequisite
The process of generating Work order involves three steps

1. [**Creation of PM Due List**](/CMMS-User's-Guide/Preventive-Maintenance-\(PM\)/PM-Due-List-%2D-Preventive-Maintenance-Due-List/Create-New-PM-Due-List) -  Allows the selection of various filter **'criteria'** to produce a list of multiple PM/Due Date
candidates

2. [**PM Forecast**](/CMMS-User's-Guide/Preventive-Maintenance-\(PM\)/PM-Due-List-%2D-Preventive-Maintenance-Due-List/PM-Forecast) - Forecast the occurrence of PMs through out the entered **'DL Criteria'**. These **'Due List candidates'** can be used to estimate labor, material and resource requirements and cost to perform this work.

3. **Generate WOs** - Once you are satisfied with the **'Due List candidates'** list of PM/Due Date combinations they
can be generated into 'new Work Orders' by following the steps mentioned below,

#Generate WOs

- Make sure, you have created ['PM Due List'](/CMMS-User's-Guide/Preventive-Maintenance-\(PM\)/PM-Due-List-%2D-Preventive-Maintenance-Due-List/Create-New-PM-Due-List) and validated the 'due list candidates' created from ['PM Forecast'](/CMMS-User's-Guide/Preventive-Maintenance-\(PM\)/PM-Due-List-%2D-Preventive-Maintenance-Due-List/PM-Forecast)

- Navigate to the PM Edit Page: From **Main Menu** -> Choose **Maintenance** -> **PM Due List** -> Click **'Edit'** icon
- From PM Due List edit page, Click the **'Generated WOs'** Tab
- Click **'Model WO'** to generate WOs
- Click **'Refresh'** to see the list of created WOs
- You can also access the generated WOs from **PM List** -> Choose a **PM** -> **Edit** -> **PM History** Tab

<center> <h1> Import Physical Inventory Count</h1> </center>
<div style='text-align: justify; padding:20px'>
A physical inventory count is the process of manually counting the stock and comparing the inventory you count to the inventory recorded in your system and then reconciling any discrepancies.
<br><br>
Import Physical Inventory Count window provides an option to perform bulk update of counted inventory quantities directly to the system with the predefined template. User must have special privileges to access this feature.
<br><br>
Importing count is a three step process

- Freeze Inventory
- Export the Items to be counted

# Freeze Inventory
Inventory Freeze provides a snap shot of Inventory quantities
at a particular point in time and populates the Physical Inventory window with on-hand
quantities for the Inventory items

- From the **'Main Menu'** -> Choose '**Inventory**' -> Click **'Physical Inventory Freeze'**
- Enter a specific **'cycle code'** to select only SKUs associated with that cycle code or leave it **'unselected'** to select all
SKUs(Inventory without cycle code will be skipped)
- Enter a **'cycle date'** to be stamped on the items included
in the Inventory freeze. By default, the current date will be loaded
- After entering Selection and Generation criteria, click the '**Freeze**' button to freeze selected
Inventory.
- On successful submission, it will redirect you automatically to the **'Physical Inventory Count'** window with the on-hand quantities for the inventory item


#Export the Items to be counted
The CSV Export button allows Physical Inventory frozen data to be exported from CHAMPS and saved to your local system as CSV
- From the **'Main Menu'** -> Choose '**Inventory**' -> Click **'Physical Inventory Count'**
- By default, all the SKUs will display status as '**Uncounted**'
- Click **'CSV Export'** button from the toolbar menu <br>![image.png](/.attachments/image-a66d0b62-16ad-4f74-ab87-2526dafe1ce4.png =100x)
- This will download a CSV file with the preloaded data from the frozen inventory item 
- Enter the '**Counted**' quantity for each SKU in the '**Counted**' column and save the file
<br>
![image.png](/.attachments/image-e0904533-43e5-49ed-afb4-7d9d41962b03.png =800x)
  
  >> For successful submission, do not change the autogenerated key in the first column named **'P Key'** 
  
#Import the Counted Parts/SKUs

The Import button allows Physical Inventory count list to be imported back into the CMMS system updating all counted parts.
- From the **'Main Menu'** -> Choose '**Inventory**' -> Click **'Physical Inventory Count'**
- Click the 'Import' button from the toolbar menu <br> ![image.png](/.attachments/image-4205671e-8f5e-4e3a-b993-9e0b48f450b1.png =100x)

![image.png](/.attachments/image-52f436ea-2521-4f0c-babb-a834a4d2e9dc.png =300x)
- Browse and select the file to import _(Please Do Not Close the Window or Click Back Button while import is in process)_
- On successful import, the counted quantity will be updated
- **'Variance'** will be calculated automatically
- And **'Status'** will be updated to '**Counted**' automatically
  >> If the import has Serialized and/or Lotted Inventory Items, the status will remain '**Uncounted**' until you add the serial/lot number.
Clicking on the '**Variance**' will open a popup window to update serial item quantity<br>
![image.png](/.attachments/image-835304d7-d07c-40d1-9607-8adb9d91e4d1.png =800x)
- Click '**Process**' check box to process the adjusted quantity. 
- Click '**Save**' 
  >> Clicking '**Save**' without having '**Process**' checkbox checked, will store the record in count window to process later

<div style='text-align: justify; padding:20px'>

The creation of a SKU record defined an item’s unique Id, description, physical properties,
and business logic. The Inventory record defines the item’s warehouse, storage bins,
lot/serial numbers, quantity, and cost information. For a SKU to be setup in Inventory it must
be flagged as an Inventoried item. Miscellaneous SKUs are never setup in Inventory. <br><br>
The Inventory window contains information about Inventory quantities and locations for each
SKU you have defined. Inventory increments or decrements Inventory quantities based on
the following transactions:
- The Purchase Orders receiving function automatically increments an item’s on-hand
quantity and decreases the on-order quantity.
- When you enter SKU codes on Material Request lines, the system increments the
committed quantity on the Inventory record.
- When materials are staged the committed quantity automatically decrements and the
staged quantity increments.
- Issuing Material Request quantities automatically decrements the on-hand quantity
and the staged quantity.

Inventory window lets you perform the following operation,

- [Create New](/CMMS-User's-Guide/Inventory-\(INV\)/Inventory-Management/Add-Inventory) - Record and Manage inventory for inventoried, Serialized, lotted SKUs
- [PO Receiving](/CMMS-User's-Guide/Inventory-\(INV\)/Inventory-Receiving)- The Purchase Orders receiving function automatically increments an item’s on-hand
quantity and decreases the on-order quantity.
- [Inventory Adjustment](/CMMS-User's-Guide/Inventory-\(INV\)/Inventory-Movement)- Allows you to move Inventory between locations, or to
adjust the Inventory quantity or price at a particular location.
- [Reorder Inventory](/CMMS-User's-Guide/Inventory-\(INV\)/Inventory-Reorder) - Monitors Inventory items at or below the reorder point and allows you to reorder inventory
- [Material Inspection](/CMMS-User's-Guide/Inventory-\(INV\)/Inventory-Receiving/Material-Inspection) - Allows you to inspect the materials received.
- [Unprocessed Receiving](/CMMS-User's-Guide/Inventory-\(INV\)/Inventory-Receiving/Unprocessed-Receiving) - Allows you to manage the received quantity that exceeds the acceptable receiving tolerance

<div style='text-align: justify; padding:20px'>
Purchase Orders are comprised of line items that are receivable and non-receivable as
defined by the SKU. Receivable Inventory and Receivable Miscellaneous PO Line Items
must be received to indicate the Vendor delivered the items.
<br><Br>

The receipt of Inventory items increases the Quantity On Hand, allocates this quantity to
Material Requests, and creates an Inventory Movement record documenting the increase
in inventory quantity and value. The receipt of Receivable Miscellaneous PO Line Items
has no effect on inventory but does charge related Work Order Steps with the Non-Stock
Actual cost of the items. The receipt of both types of items creates a Receive record that
is used in the AP Invoice Matching process. Miscellaneous non-Receivable PO Line
Items are immediately eligible to pay for since no receipts are performed against them.
<br><Br>

The receipt of PO Line Items is controlled by the **'Purchasing Control'** associated with the
SKU. Purchasing Control enforces the receipt quantity is within tolerances applied to the
original order quantity and can also be used to require items to be inspected. This is
called [**'Unprocessed Receiving'**](/CMMS-User's-Guide/Inventory-\(INV\)/Inventory-Receiving/Unprocessed-Receiving) and adds a second step to the receiving process.

The Inventory Reorder window should be used at regular intervals to initiate the inventory replenishment process. The output from this process will be the generation of new Blanket PO Releases and Purchase Requests based on the existence of Blanket POs and Inventory AutoReq preferences.

If a Batch number is created and associated with Reorder process, the new Purchase Orders generated may be found by searching using the Batch.

>>If Reorder Inventory is to work for a SKU, you must first have:
Flagged item for Auto Requisition on the Inventory window. Settings must be Yes or Yes-Approved.
Optionally, setup the item on a blanket Purchase Order.
Established a reorder point and a maximum quantity for the SKU in the Inventory window.
Set up a primary Vendor for the SKU with a Unit of Measure that matches what is stated in the Inventory window.

#Prerequisite
- Make sure, the inventory has value entered in [Minimum and Maximum](/CMMS-User's-Guide/Inventory-\(INV\)/Inventory-Management/Inventory-%2D-Field-Definitions/INV-%2D-Inventory-Tab) fields
- Ensure the SKU has an active [**'Default Vendor'**](/CMMS-User's-Guide/Inventory-\(INV\)/SKU/Manage-Vendor-Price-List). Vendor price List tab allows to select the default vendor by setting the primary indicator
- **'On Hand'** quantity needs to be below the specified minimum amount for SKU to appear on the window.

#Procedure
- Go to **'Reorder Inventory'**
- This window displays the list of Inventory items at or below the reorder point.
- Enter the search criteria to find the specific item
  - Use the Filter **'<= Minimum'** button to exclude the items that you may not want to hold in

<center> <h1> MATERIAL REQUEST </h1> </center>
<div style='text-align: justify; padding:20px'>

Material Requests (MRs) allow the selection and reservation of Inventory during the Work
Order material planning process, as required from the MR module, and as an automatic
function of PM Tasking and Job Plan modeling.

Inventory Adjustment Issues and Returns represent ‘walk-up’ transactions performed over the-counter with individual SKUs. A Material Request may be planned, staged, released,
and issued with multiple SKUs at one time.

Since Bill of Material does not indicate Site or Location at the line item level, PM Tasking
and Job Plan modeling functions attempt to generate the MR from the current User’s
Session Default Company and Location values. It is imperative that the Default Company
and Location be defined on the User record for anyone performing PM Tasking or Job Plan
modeling.

Like an Inventory Adjustment Issue, a Material Request (MR) must be charged to a GL
Account and optionally, a WO Step and/or Project Task. If a WO Step or Project Task is
entered, its associated GL Account will also be loaded into the MR by default.

<div style='text-align: justify; padding:20px'>
The Material Request Issue/Return window must be used to issue inventory items out of the 
warehouse and charge them to the Account, Work Order Step, and Project Task selected 
when creating the reservation. 
<br><br>
The Material Request Issue/Return window has three tabs; MR Details, Issue MRs, and 
Return MRs.

# MR Details Tab
Use the MR Details Tab window to retrieve and view Material Requests and verify the 
correct MR is about to be issued. No editing of the MR is performed on this tab.

# Issue MR Tab
Staged and Partially Staged Line Items can be issued. The Issue MRs tab is designed to make issuing parts as fast as possible. 

- When the tab is first selected, a message prompt will ask, **‘Would you like to issue the entire MR?’** 

- If you respond with **'Yes'**, the Qty to Issue will be automatically populated with the staged 
quantity remaining to be issued for each line item. 
- If you respond **'No'**, you can enter the **'Qty to Issue'** amount manually for just those items you want to issue.

- The person receiving the parts may be selected from the **'Issued'** list drop-down provided by the Badge ID
- Click on the '**Issue**' button at the bottom to issue part to the assigned Badge Id. (The Issue button will appear at the bottom only after entering the valid value in **'Quantity to Issue'** box)
<br><br>

## Understanding MR Issue
- Backordered Line Items cannot be issued and the Issue Qty should be set to zero.
- The application assumes the total Qty Required should be issued (minus any quantity that has 
already been issued) but permits less than the Qty Required to be issued. 
- The issue function updates Inventory Qty On Hand and Staged Qty, creates an Inventory Movement 
record, and creates a WO Task Actual Cost, record if required.
- If the part exists within multiple Bins, the primary is displayed but another valid Bin id may be 
selected. The Issue Qty cannot be greater than the On Hand Qty in the selected Bin. 
Multiple partial issues may need to be performed to relieve the Qty Required from different 
Bins

- If the Line Item Qty Required is completely issued, the item’s status is displayed as Issued. 

- If all items have been issued, the MR Header status is displayed as Closed. 

- If this is the only MR associated with a WO task, the Status field’s ‘MR Not Issued’ will be 
cleared. The ‘MR Not Issued’ flag may be used within workflow setup to prevent the 
completion of a WO Task if outstanding MRs exists. (Other system-controlled WO Step 
Status flags include ‘PR Open’ and ‘PO Open’. These flags are set/cleared on the PR, PR 
Transfer, PO, PO Receipt, and PO Return windows.

  >> The issue of a Lot Controlled, Serialized, or Lot Controlled/Serialized part will display a 
Lot/Serial window requiring the input of a valid lot number and/or serial number. 

#Return MR Tab
The MR Issue/Return window’s Return MR tab permits multiple parts to be returned against 
the MR. The Return MR tab basically performs the opposite functions as the Issue tab. The 
Return tab does not permit more to be returned to the line item than has been issued. The 
line item status is not affected by a return

- Navigate to the **'MR** Return' tab
- Enter 'Quantity to Return 
- Click on the '**Return**' button at the bottom

   >>The return of a Lot Controlled, Serialized, or Lot Controlled/Serialized part will display a 
Lot/Serial window requiring the input of a valid lot number and/or serial number

<center> <h1> MR RESERVATION  </h1> </center>


<div style='text-align: justify; padding:20px;'>
A Material Request and its Line Items are Reserved on the MR Edit window. The Line Item status is based on available Inventory. 

- When the Inventory Qty On Hand increases, MR 
Line Items are automatically allocated (in descending order of Priority, Required Date and 
MR number) the additional amount. 
- If the Inventory Qty On Hand decreases, MR Line Items  are automatically de-allocated.


The Line Item Reservation window is provided to manually move allocated, Staged 
quantities from one MR to another. 
>> **Note:**  The Line Item Status defaults to Estimate when the MR is initially entered. It should be manually changed to 'Open' and saved to process further

# Reserve MR

- From the **'Main Menu'** -> Click **'Inventory'** -> Click **'Material Request'** to open the MR Browse window which will list all the available MRs
- Identify the MR that you want to reserve
- Click on the '**Edit**' icon next to the MR ID
- Make sure, your material request **status** is set to 'Open' in order to reserve the MR.
- Click '**Reserve**' button from the top menu <br> ![image.png](/.attachments/image-0f7c2c37-8ef5-4cf8-81ea-fb2ffbc0b531.png =80x)
- Click '**Save**'
- Based on the availability, each line item status will be updated.

>> A new MR Line Item has an initial status of **_Estimate_** and has no impact on Inventory.  When 
the MR status is set to **_Open_**, the Line Items will change to **_Open_** and will be 
considered Committed Inventory.

<br> ![image.png](/.attachments/image-0f7c2c37-8ef5-4cf8-81ea-fb2ffbc0b531.png =80x)
- All the valid line items with the status 'Open' will be reserved and updated with the new status (staged or partially staged or backordered ) based on its availability


#Understanding MR Statuses

When an MR Line Item has been **_Reserved_**, its status will be **_Staged_** (Green). A **_Staged_** Item can have its required quantity completely issued. 

**_Partially Staged_** (Yellow), or Backordered (Red) status items indicate incomplete availability. A Partially Staged Item can only have some of its required quantity issued. 


A **_Backordered_** Item cannot have any parts issued.

<center> <h1> METER </h1> </center>

<div style='text-align: justify; padding:20px'>
The Preventive Maintenance module's Meters are used to maintain devices used to monitor
equipment performance and trigger PM jobs. Once Meter records are established, multiple
PM jobs, each with their own defined trigger points, may be associated to them.
<br><Br>
Meters might be manually updated, surveyed using batch data collection devices, or
updated from PM or Process Control values. Any runtime or condition to be monitored may
be created as a Meter Id. The Meter Id can retain the history of recorded values.
<br><br>
Metering points represent any value being recorded that is used to trigger PM tasks.
Equipment may employ pressure, temperature, mileage, units produced, etc., as values that
could trigger a PM.
<br><br>
Meters may be used to monitor assets such as plant equipment and, based upon specified
values, may trigger PM jobs. For example, perform oil change every 3000 miles, perform
rebuild every 10,000 hours, perform inspection when temperature exceeds 180 F, etc.

<center> <h1>Overtime Field Definitions</h1></center>
<div style= 'text-align: justify; padding:10px'>


Overtime Codes are used to define the multipliers that may be used to calculate overtime hours. For example, an Overtime Code defined for time and a half would be associated with a 1.5 numeric value. The Overtime Codes window permits maintenance of a list of valid
codes.

<br></br>

Overtime codes are associated with a Multiplier value that is used to determine the total hours for which an employee will be paid. The Overtime Multiplier is used in the following formula:
Regular hrs + (OT hrs x OT Multiplier) = Timecard Total Hours
For Example: An employee works 40 regular hours and 5 hours overtime. The overtime rate is based upon a multiplier that has been defined as “time and a half = 1.5 Multiplier value.” Total hours to be charged would be calculated as follows:
40 Regular hrs + 7.5 overtime hrs (5 hrs x 1.5 Multiplier = 7.5) = 47.5 total hrs charged.

| ID | Unique identifier for this overtime code. **(Required)** | ![image.png](/.attachments/image-c156e81c-4fb2-49ed-8fcb-38fefd8777d3.png) |  |

The CHAMPS Permits module provides Permit to Work management functionality to support the Preventive Maintenance and Work Order modules. 

  
>> // Insert Updated Picture Maybe //
  

The following is a list of application features:
- CHAMPS Permit module allows the definition of RichText a Template document that describes the permit details, steps and procedures. This form Template can be used when establishing active Permits.

- Permit Templates are created by using the ‘Permit Type’ as a source for the formtext. Multiple Permit templates may be created from the same ‘Permit Type’ code. The Permit Auto Comments will automatically populate the fields, saving you valuable time in creating new Permits.

- Permits provide Workflow State management and Route Slip approval.

- Permits may be associated with PM Tasks. Associating a Permit Template to a PM Task indicates that Permits are required, and the permit document(s) will be created for the Work Order Step when it is generated from the PM Task.

- Permits can be created and then later associated to Work Order Steps. A Permit may be shared by multiple Work Orders.
<center><h1> Personnel</center></h1>


Personnel Badge records are created to establish an employee or contractor within the 
CHAMPS system, permitting maintenance of information specific to their activities and 
status within the company and tracking of labor costs, material transactions, resource 
availability, etc.
The Personnel Browse window displays a list of Badge IDs entered within the system. To 
access the Personnel Browse window, choose Personnel from the Work Force menu.

Personnel List allows you to record and maintain the following sets of information:

<center> <h1> Physical Inventory Count & Adjustment </h1> </center>
<div style='text-align: justify; padding:20px'>
A physical inventory count is the process of manually counting the stock and comparing the inventory you count to the inventory recorded in your  system and then reconciling any discrepancies.
<br><br>
Physical Inventory Count window is used to adjust on-hand Inventory quantities to
match a Physical Inventory count. Physical inventory adjustment process involved two steps,

- Freeze Inventory
- Physical Inventory count and Adjustment

#Prerequisite

- Cycle code must be populated before you can begin your Physical Inventory counts. Inventory Items without cycle code will not be frozen to perform physical count.

>> Cycle codes are used to divide a warehouse into subsets to simplify Physical Inventory and cycle counts. You can setup cycle code in [Inventory -> Inventory List -> Edit icon next to the selected SKU -> Select Cycle Code](/CMMS-User's-Guide/Inventory-\(INV\)/Inventory-Management/Inventory-%2D-Field-Definitions)


# Freeze Inventory
Use the Inventory Freeze/Unfreeze window to begin reconciling the on-hand Inventory
quantities to a physical count. Inventory Freeze provides a snap shot of Inventory quantities
at a particular point in time and populates the Physical Inventory window with on-hand
quantities for the Inventory items that you select. 


- From the **'Main Menu'** -> Choose '**Inventory**' -> Click **'Physical Inventory Freeze'**
- Enter a specific **'cycle code'** to select only SKUs associated with that cycle code or leave it **'unselected'** to select all
SKUs(Inventory without cycle code will be skipped)
- Enter a **'cycle date'** to be stamped on the items included
in the Inventory freeze. By default, the current date will be loaded
- After entering Selection and Generation criteria, click the '**Freeze**' button to freeze selected
Inventory.
- On successful submission, it will redirect you automatically to the **'Physical Inventory Count'** window with the on-hand quantities for the inventory item

# Physical Inventory Count and Adjustment
Use the Physical Inventory window to enter the physical counts of Inventory items that you
selected during Inventory freeze.

- From the **'Main Menu'** -> Choose '**Inventory**' -> Click **'Physical Inventory Count'**
- By default, all the SKUs will display status as 'Uncounted'
- Enter '**Counted**' quantity for each SKU
  >> If a SKU for which a Serial and/or Lot number has been assigned is frozen, entering the
 count in the Physical Qty field and pressing the Tab key will open the Serial/Lot window to adjust quantity as required
- After entering quantity, **'Variance'** will be calculated automatically
- And **'Status'** will be updated to 'Counted' automatically
- Click '**Process**' check box to process the adjusted quantity. 
- Click '**Save**' 
  >> Clicking '**Save**' without having '**Process**' checkbox checked, will store the record in count window to process later
- The gain or loss of inventory quantity and value will be documented in a [Movement](/CMMS-User's-Guide/Inventory-\(INV\)/Inventory-Movement) record.

<center> <h1> PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE FUNCTIONS </h1> </center>

<div style='text-align: justify; padding:20px'>

A CHAMPS Preventive Maintenance (PM) defines a repeatable procedure performed against one or more Equipment assets on a calendar cycle or meter-driven frequency. Preventive maintenance is maintenance that is regularly and routinely performed on physical assets to reduce the chances of equipment failure and unplanned machine downtime that can be very costly for maintenance teams and facility managers.

A preventive maintenance task is performed to prevent unexpected break downs. The exact timing of when you should use preventive maintenance will vary depending on the equipment and the operation it is performing. You can follow the manufacturer guidelines to help determine preventive maintenance schedules and inspection so that assets do not run to failure. Creating a preventive maintenance schedule will help ensure proactive maintenance rather than resorting to costly reactive maintenance if the equipment starts to fail unexpectedly.

A PM can be set up as calendar frequency trigger, performance based trigger and usage based trigger. CMMS allows you to create new PM in the following ways
- [Create PM from scratch](/CMMS-User's-Guide/Preventive-Maintenance-\(PM\)/PM-%2D-Preventive-Maintenance/Create-New-PM)
- [Create PM from WO (Model PM)](/CMMS-User's-Guide/Work-Order-\(WO\)/Work-Order-\(WO\)/Work-Order-\(WO\)-%2D-Functions/Model-PM-from-WO)
- [Create PM from JP (Model PM)](/CMMS-User's-Guide/Job-Plan-\(JP\)/Model-PM-from-JP)

<B>[Model PM: ](/CMMS-User's-Guide/Preventive-Maintenance-\(PM\)/PM-%2D-Preventive-Maintenance/Model-PM) </B> When Modeling a PM, it Replicates a selected, existing PM to create a new PM.

<B>[Associate Meter to PM: ](/CMMS-User's-Guide/Preventive-Maintenance-\(PM\)/PM-%2D-Preventive-Maintenance/Associate-Meter-to-PM) </b>PMs may have various meters associated to them, which may be set up to trigger based
upon specified readings or values. 

<B>[Auto Generate PM ID:](/CMMS-User's-Guide/Preventive-Maintenance-\(PM\)/PM-%2D-Preventive-Maintenance/Configure-Auto-ID-for-PM) </b> Allows you to define the sequential order in which the system generates Preventive Maintenance IDs automatically.

<div style='text-align: justify; padding:20px'>
PM Due list page lets you choose the WO Generation criteria. Due Lists are generated based upon the criteria entered on the Due List Page's

<div style='text-align: justify; padding:10px'>

The process of generating PMs into Work Orders involves the creation of a Due List record that allows the selection of various filter criteria to produce a list of multiple PM/Due Date candidates. For example; we may want to create a list of PM candidates due from now to the end of the next month that are related to Motors. A PM may appear multiple times on this list if it has a Weekly frequency. Each forecasted due date occurrence is displayed on the generated Due List. (The same PM would only appear once on the PM Browse with its current Due Date.)

The Due List can be used to forecast the occurrence of PMs throughout the specified From/To date range. This Due List can be used with a labor and material forecast report to predict the estimated resource requirements and cost to perform this work.

Once you are satisfied with the Due List candidate list of PM/Due Date combinations they can be generated into new Work Orders and printed. The Due List may be retained for later review or deleted once it has generated the appropriate Work Orders.


As described, the process of generating Work order involves three steps

1. [**Creation of New PM Due List**](/CMMS-User's-Guide/Preventive-Maintenance-\(PM\)/PM-Due-List-%2D-Preventive-Maintenance-Due-List/Create-New-PM-Due-List) -  Allows the selection of various filter **'criteria'** to produce a list of multiple PM/Due Date
candidates
2. [**PM Forecast**](/CMMS-User's-Guide/Preventive-Maintenance-\(PM\)/PM-Due-List-%2D-Preventive-Maintenance-Due-List/PM-Forecast) - Forecast the occurrence of PMs through out the entered **'DL Criteria'**. These **'Due List candidates'** can be used to estimate labor, material and resource requirements and cost to perform this work.
3. [**Generate WOs**](/CMMS-User's-Guide/Preventive-Maintenance-\(PM\)/PM-Due-List-%2D-Preventive-Maintenance-Due-List/Generate-WOs) - Once you are satisfied with the **'Due List candidates'** list of PM/Due Date combinations they
can be generated into 'new Work Orders'

<center> <h1> PM Forecast </h1> </center>


<div style='text-align: justify; padding:20px;'>
Forecast tab generates list of the PMs that have been forecasted based upon the entered criteria. The list may be manipulated to attempt to match potential jobs with available resources.
<br><Br>
PM Scheduled dates may be entered and adjusted to level resource demands during the specified date range or to reschedule a PM having a due date falling on a non-working day such as a holiday, weekend, etc. PMs on the list may be checked as cancelled to prevent their generation into work orders. Simply click the checkbox again to re-activate a PM. The PMs tab displays both cancelled and active PMs.
<br><br>
Once a particular Due List has been satisfactorily tailored to match potential jobs with available resources, the Due List of PMs may be tasked (or converted) into work orders.

#Procedure

- **Prerequisite:** First, [Due List must be created](/CMMS-User's-Guide/Preventive-Maintenance-\(PM\)/PM-Due-List-%2D-Preventive-Maintenance-Due-List/Create-New-PM-Due-List) with valid Due List Criteria to create PM Forecast **(Mandatory)**

- On successful **'PM Duelist creation'**, go to **'PM Edit'** Page by navigating through, <br> **Main Menu** -> Choose **Maintenance** -> **PM Due List** -> Click **'Edit'** icon on the Due List you are intended to create Forecast -> **'Forecast'** tab

- From **'PM Forecast'** tab, Click **'Generate'** button <br>![image.png](/.attachments/image-5aeadf53-7393-4872-8374-6e87fc5ef4dd.png =120x)

- On clicking **'Generate'**, the page displays the list of PMs(referred as '**Due List Candidates**') that have forecasted based upon entered criteria and due date range. ('Refresh' the page if you are having trouble viewing the updated list)

- **'Schedule Date'** can be adjusted to level resource demands during the specified date range or to reschedule a PM having a due date falling on a non-working day

- Check **'Cancel'** box to prevent generating work orders for selected 'Due list candidates'. A PM that is checked as cancelled will
not be generated into a work order when the due list is processed. To
reactivate a cancelled PM, simply click the Cancel box again. (Once the
due list has been generated into work orders, changes may no longer
made to the list.)

- Enter **'Comments'** indicating why this PM is being cancelled from this list. These comments can be viewed in the [PM History tab](/CMMS-User's-Guide/Preventive-Maintenance-\(PM\)/PM-%2D-Preventive-Maintenance/PM-%2D-Field-Definitions/PM-%2D-PM-History-Tab)

- Click **'Save'**

- Once you are satisfied with the Due List candidate list of PM/Due Date combinations they
can be generated into new Work Orders 

#Additional Information

- A Due List may be re-forecasted with different criteria as long as it has not been
generated into Work Orders. Once the Work Order Generation process has been
performed, the Due List columns will be protected from change.

- Once a due list has been processed and generated into WOs, the Generate WO function will be
unavailable

- Dates such as 'Plan Lead Days', 'Grace Period', 'Except From', 'Except To' and 'Last Due Date' entered during [PM Creation](/CMMS-User's-Guide/Preventive-Maintenance-\(PM\)/PM-%2D-Preventive-Maintenance/Create-New-PM) will affect the WO generation dates

- Project Tasks accumulate their own Estimated, Committed, and Actual costs from Inventory Issues, Purchasing Receipts and AP Vouchering of non-Inventory items, Timecards, manually entered Work Order Step Actual Costs and Project Task Adjustments.

- The Project Cost Accumulation can email Project Planners when their projects approach a pre-defined Actual/Committed percentage of the original Estimate.

- Projects support Approval routing and electronic Attachments.

Project Tracking allows you to record and maintain the following sets of information:
- [**General Tab**](/CMMS-User's-Guide/Project-Tracking-\(PT\)/Project-Tracking-%2D-Field-Definitions/PT-%2D-General-Tab)
- [**Cost Tab**](/CMMS-User's-Guide/Project-Tracking-\(PT\)/Project-Tracking-%2D-Field-Definitions/PT-%2D-Cost-Tab)

<div style='text-align: justify; padding:20px'>

CMMS allows you to create and manage purchase order in many ways by utilizing information available in one or more modules,
- Create Purchase Order from scratch without a PR ([Create New - Purchase Order](/CMMS-User's-Guide/Purchasing-\(PUR\)/Purchase-Order-\(PO\)/Purchase-Order-\(PO\)-Functions/Create-New-%2D-Purchase-Order))
- Convert from approved Purchase Requests to purchase order [PR Line Transfer](/CMMS-User's-Guide/Purchasing-\(PUR\)/Purchase-Requisition-\(PR\)/Purchase-Request-\(PR\)-%2D-Functions/Transfer-PR-Lines-to-PO))
- Convert from quotes to purchase order (VQ to PO)
- Release from Blanket PO to purchase order ([Release BPO Lines](/CMMS-User's-Guide/Purchasing-\(PUR\)/Blanket-Purchase-Order-\(BPO\)/Release-BPO-Lines))
- Convert from WO requiring Materials to purchase order  [WO Materials to PO](/CMMS-User's-Guide/Work-Order-\(WO\)/Work-Order-Task--\(WOT\)/Work-Order-Task-\(WOT\)-%2D-Functions/Create-New-Purchase-Order-\(PO\)-from-WO-Task)

Purchase Order allows you to perform the following operations effectively,
<br>

<B>[Manage PO Status](/CMMS-User's-Guide/Purchasing-\(PUR\)/Purchase-Order-\(PO\)/Purchase-Order-\(PO\)-Functions/Manage-PO-Status) </B>A Purchase Order remains open until you have fully received all of the items, canceled the
order or transferred the information to a voucher. Once you have received or cancelled a
PO, the status of the order automatically updates to ‘Closed’.

<br>
<B>[Manage PO Approvals](/CMMS-User's-Guide/Purchasing-\(PUR\)/Purchase-Order-\(PO\)/Purchase-Order-\(PO\)-Functions/Manage-PO-Approvals) </B> Purchase Orders may require approval based on the Application Configuration.
This allows Buyers to create orders, without a Purchase Request, and self-approve them
up to an established spending limit. Purchase Order Printing can be controlled based on
the Approval condition.<br><br>
<B>[Manage Distribution Lines (PO)](/CMMS-User's-Guide/Purchasing-\(PUR\)/Purchase-Order-\(PO\)/Purchase-Order-\(PO\)-Functions/Manage-Distribution-Lines-\(PO\)):</B>

The CHAMPS Purchasing component provides flexible full-function enterprise capabilities assisted by user 
defined work flow routing to help speed decisions throughout the organization. 
<br><br>
 Purchase Order includes the date of the order, FOB shipping information, discount terms, names of the buyer and seller, description of the goods being purchased, item number, price, quantity, and the PO number. Purchase order can be subject to approval and clearance <br><Br>

CHAMPS Purchasing  allows three-way matching of the purchase order, parts received, and the vendor's invoice. The system also provides for discrepancy tracking and variance approval.
<Br><Br>
Purchase orders play a major role in the inventory management process. When the supplier receives the PO, they will take the items listed in the PO from their inventory. The PO helps keep a record of the inventory on hand and identify any discrepancies between the values shown in the records and the actual stock.

Purchase order allows you to record and manage following set of information

<center> <h1> PURCHASE REQUEST - FIELD DEFINITIONS </h1> </center>

<div style='text-align: justify; padding:20px'>

A purchase requisition is often an internal document created by your employee to request the purchasing of goods or services from an vendor.
The procurement department then uses the purchase request to create a purchase order, after requesting quotes from several vendors. <br><Br>
The Purchase Requisition is a Workflow-enabled document. This allows Requisition 
Types and States to be established that can trigger approval routing requirements.
<br><br>
Purchase Request allows you to record and manage following set of information

Purchase Requests are generated by the Inventory Reorder process to replenish stock items and manually
entered by Users requiring additional inventory items, non-stock items, and services. <br><Br>
Purchase Requests are usually approved prior to them being converted into Purchase
Orders. Each Purchase Request Line Item may be converted into different Purchase
Order Line Items.
Because Purchase Requisitions are often created by non-buyers, (personnel who are
unfamiliar with specific Vendor information), the Vendor code and SKU codes may be left
blank when first created.

<center> <h1>REPORTS</h1> </center>
<div style='text-align: justify; padding:20px;'>

CHAMPS has multiple methods of reporting on the data contained in the system. The document Grids can be filtered, searched and exported. The RDLC module (now considered Legacy Reports) allowed users to upload, configure, and run reports created in Microsoft's report writing tool. These report files have an extension of .rdlc, which stands for Report Definition Language Client-side. The latest Reporting pages in CHAMPS have been designed to upload, configure, and run Telerik reports. These have a file extension of .trdp.

# Report Interface

The Report Grid shows a list of available Reports.

The Report View page gives a preview of the report that can be searched, filtered, viewed in various ways and printed or exported.

| Receive Required | Indicates that you will physically receive the item. Selecting **Receive Required** indicates that you receive and track the Inventory item by unit, which also means that you must receive the item before you can voucher it in Accounts Payable. A SKU that does not require receipt indicates that the item is not usually inventoried – it is not physically received – and is generally a service (e.g., janitorial or legal services). | ![Recieve REquired.png](/.attachments/Recieve%20REquired-adf5fca0-e211-40f1-bdbf-9406e5a8549f.png)
| Inventoried | Indicates that the item is held in Inventory. When the “Inventoried” check box is **not** selected, thus indicating that you are entering a non-inventoried SKU, you can enter a list price and a standard cost for the item. The system uses the list price and cost dollars you enter in this window when creating price breaks for the non-inventoried item. However, when the check box is selected (indicating that you are entering an inventoried SKU), you need to enter list price and standard cost information in the Inventory window. | ![Inventoried.png](/.attachments/Inventoried-3edc963f-f53e-4b8d-87f8-7d45c009e40b.png)

| Miscellaneous | Indicates a SKU used for a non-Inventory item. You can identify a SKU as  “Miscellaneous” to handle purchased items that you typically do not hold in Inventory. For instance, you might create one miscellaneous SKU to use for non-inventoried purchases such as office supplies, rather than create an individual SKU for every pen, pencil, etc. if you select the **Miscellaneous** check box, the default SKU Description may be changed on purchase orders and requisitions. | ![Miscellaneous.png](/.attachments/Miscellaneous-2cbc19b0-d66f-460a-99e3-f1813fd5bf16.png)
| Pickable | Indicates this item is picked from Inventory. A SKU may be defined for documentation or paperwork that is always held in a file cabinet and not ‘picked’ from a Shelf/Bin when assembling a kit or assembly. | ![Pickable.png](/.attachments/Pickable-060a84b1-8642-407b-828d-5339f22be372.png)
| Voucher Taxable | Indicates that tax should be applied to the item on a voucher. | ![Voucther Taxable.png](/.attachments/Voucther%20Taxable-670ee915-1fe2-47e3-8051-3cca100fcefc.png)
| Lots | Invokes lot tracking on received goods. Automatic generation of Lot Id is based on an application option and NextNo. Setting. | ![LOTS.png](/.attachments/LOTS-4adb09be-6df6-40da-b955-f62c11cafdc9.png)
| Shelf Life | Shelf Life tracking requires the use of Lots. Inventory cannot be processed once the Shelf Life Date has expired. Shelf Life Dates can be extended if needed. | ![Shelf Life.png](/.attachments/Shelf%20Life-4188959c-8e40-432d-ade2-0f7f7f654ce4.png)
| Auto Issue | Indicates that upon Purchase Order receipt of the SKU, it will be automatically issued. | ![Auto Issue.png](/.attachments/Auto%20Issue-d6e43a99-14e8-4710-9810-cafa9c8faede.png)
| Auto BOM | Indicates that upon issue of the SKU, it may be added to a Bill Of Material. | ![Auto BOM.png](/.attachments/Auto%20BOM-ef234269-d3ae-4cd6-9576-350f7f9922be.png)

<center> <h1> SKU Control Codes </h1> </center>
<div style='text-align: justify; padding:20px'>

Use the Purchase Order Control window to define receiving tolerance limits and
receiving rules. Purchasing control codes create groups of receiving rules that apply
directly to SKU codes. Receiving tolerances are the maximum allowable overage
available on a SKU before it requires approval. During receiving, if the overage exceeds
the allowable tolerance, CHAMPS displays the message, “Variance has occurred on
units or rate.” Items exceeding the variance limits require approval from the PO Buyer.

If a voucher varies from the purchase order price, the voucher is set to “Unapproved.”
Define receiving tolerances on the purchase control record associated with a SKU.

There are two types of tolerances - Unit flat and Unit %.
- A unit flat tolerance specifies the number of units over the order quantity that you can
receive. 
- A unit % tolerance specifies the allowable percentage of units over the order
quantity.

PO Receiving sends an In Tray approval record to the Buyer Code’s associated User if
either one of these tolerances is violated.
The Purchasing Control window can also be used to flag items for Quality Control
inspection

>>Purchase controls affect the Purchase Order Receiving process. For
example, if “No early Shipment” purchase control is selected for the SKU, you
could not receive the item until the date it is expected. You setup this
information in the Purchase Order Control window. This field defaults from the
SKU Category window if you select a category that has a purchase control
connected to it. 

#Procedure

- From the **'Bottom Menu'** -> Choose **'Administration'** -> Choose **'App Config'** -> Click **'SKU Control Code'**
- Click on the '**New**' icon to add new setup. If you already have one, identify the record and click on the '**Edit**' Icon
- Enter an user defined '**ID**'
- Enter a brief '**description**' of a SKU Control code.
- Choose '**Tolerance**', When checked, this option applies set receiving tolerances to the Purchase
Order Control code.
   - Enter '**Unit Flat**', Unit quantity Receiving tolerance limit. Indicates the PO Receipt Quantity
cannot exceed the original PO Ordered Quantity by specific amount.
   - Enter '**Unit Percentage**', Unit percentage Receiving tolerance limit. Indicates the PO Receipt Quantity
cannot exceed the original PO Ordered Quantity by a specified percentage
- Choose '**Reject Partial Ship**' which indicates that the Receipt quantity cannot be less than the PO Quantity
- Choose '**Reject Early Ship**' which indicates that the Receipt cannot be earlier than the PO required date
  - Enter '**Days**'. If the Reject Early shipment checkbox is checked, this indicates the number
of days the shipment can be early and still accepted.
- Choose '**Inspection Required**'. When checked, this option indicates that Inspection is Required upon PO
receipt
  - Enter inspection '**Type**'. If the Inspection Required checkbox is checked, this indicates the Type of
Inspection required. For example, Visual Inspection, Non-Destructive Test,
Test to Failure, etc.
- Choose '**Inspect QA**'. When checked, this option indicates that Quality Assurance and Testing will
be accomplished on this Purchase Order Control code.

- Click '**Save**'

<center> <h1> MATERIAL REQUEST - STATUS </h1> </center>
<div style='text-align: justify; padding:20px'>

A Material Request may be planned, staged, released, and issued with multiple SKUs at one time.

# MR Line Status

- **Estimate:** A new MR Line Item has an initial status of Estimate and has no impact on Inventory. 
- **Open**: The Line Item Status will default to Estimate when the MR is initially entered. The
MR is manually changed to an Open status. An Open status does not guarantee parts will be available, it merely indicates the required
quantity could be met by the Qty Available. 
- **Staged:** When an MR Line Item has been Reserved, its status will be Staged (Green). A Staged Item can have its required quantity completely issued. 
- **Partially Staged:** Partially Staged status items indicate incomplete availability (Yellow). A Partially Staged Item can only have some of its required quantity issued. 
- **Backordered:** Backordered status items indicate incomplete availability (Red). A Backordered Item cannot have any parts issued
- **Issued** : Material is issued out of the warehouse and charged to the account
- **Cancelled** : The materials are not needed at all and the request is canceled.
- **Closed**:  MRs that have been completely issued are set as Closed. MRs are not automatically deleted after they have
been issued.

# Understanding MR Status
An Open status does not guarantee parts will be available, it merely indicates the required
quantity could be met by the Qty Available. (Eg. Part Qty Available = 10 and 2 MR’s request
10 parts each. Both MR Lines will be Open until the Reservation process is performed. If
the Line Item Reservation window is used, one of the MR’s will be Staged and the other will
become Backordered.)

Open status items add to the Part Qty Committed column. Staged status item quantities add
to the Part Qty Staged column and subtract from the Part Qty Committed column. 

Only Staged and Partially Staged status line items may be issued against the MR.
If a part is not required on an MR, the status can be set to Canceled. Once canceled, the
line item cannot be modified. If the part is now required again, a new Line Item should be
added to the MR.

MR’s must be approved prior to any Reservation process. If the MR is generated from PM
Tasking, it is automatically approved. (MR’s written against a WO Step must be manually
approved.)

The Reserve Parts function sets the line items to Staged if sufficient parts are available. Once
Reserved in this manner, the MR’s Reserve Lock indicator is set to prevent later allocation of
its parts to another MR on the Line Item Reservation

The Material Request Release function provides the requestor with the ability to
‘release’ the request for issue to warehouse staff in more manageable amounts.

Issue/Return function is used to issue inventory items out of the
warehouse and charge them to the Account, Work Order Step, and Project Task selected
when creating the reservation. 

The line item status is automatically
changed by the allocation of available inventory when the Qty On Hand increases
due to positive adjustments and PO Receipts. The status also changes
automatically due to de-allocation caused by negative adjustments.

<center> <h1> Unprocessed Receiving </h1> </center>
<div style='text-align: justify; padding:20px'>
Purchase Order Receiving creates an unprocessed receipt record when you enter a
received quantity that exceeds the acceptable receiving tolerance as defined by the
SKU’s purchase control code. You can either return the unprocessed quantity to the vendor or process the receiving to add to inventory. Before the unprocessed receive quantity can be processed, the PO Buyer must view the In Tray item related to the receipt and accept the
received quantity. Once the receipt quantity has been accepted, the Buyer can approve
the In Tray item. <br><br>
Once approved by the Buyer, the Unprocessed Receipt may be processed by the
inventory control staff. This process creates Receive records to support payment for the
items and increases the On Hand quantity if the item is Inventoried.

<div style='text-align: justify; padding:20px'>
Vendor Management is extremely important for inventory management, logistics as well as the Financial Accounting module. As you use a Vendor, a history of performance will be accumulated. The details of the vendor such as the payment terms, address, group, payment methods, etc. are picked up from the vendor module and provided to the other modules as and when necessary.
<BR><BR>
Vendors may be organized by groups and can be shared across locations. For Example,. a business may have different account groups for international, domestic and one-time vendors. Similar settings can then be defined once and used for all the vendors in the same vendor account group
<br><br>
You can enter and maintain a supplier’s Vendor name and address information and maintain the names and addresses of salespersons. Approve and activate vendors in CMMS along with Vendor payment and tax information.
You must set up a Vendor record in CMMSS for each supplier from whom you buy
goods or services. Without these Vendor records, you cannot process vouchers in
Accounts Payable or POs in Purchasing. However, CMMS does not require you to
select a Vendor when you create requisitions, though you cannot transfer a requisition to

<center> <h1>VENDOR TERMS CODE</h1> </center>


<div style='text-align: justify; padding:20px;'>
Vendor Terms / Payment terms are used to setup payment conditions between the vendor and organization to settle the payment of invoices. Terms Codes that are defined here are used by Purchasing and Accounts Payable.  You can setup terms to be based on specific days
of the month or relative to the Accounts Payable voucher due date. You can also setup multi-level discount terms
<br><br>


|FIELD|DEFINITION  |
|--|--|
|ID  | User-defined Term code |
|Description| User-defined Term code description |
|Type | Term Type: The system defines five options: Days, Multi-discount, Next Due On, Next Month and Same Month. <i>(Pls see details below)</i> |
|Due Days|For terms with a type of “Days” specify the number of days from the voucher date when payment is due|
|Discount Days|How many days within this Term that a discount will be applied|
|Discount Percent|Percent of discount given if within the Term parameters|
|Day|If Term applies to a specific day of the week, enter it here. |
|Application|Application to which the Term will apply: Accounts Payable, Accounts Receivable or both.|
|Next Due Date|Next Due date on Term. (If you have assigned the Term type of NextDue On.)|
|Hierarchy| Location|
|Active|Status of Term: Active or Inactive.|

#Term Type:
-Select <b>"Multi-discount terms"</b>, to define the discount
dates and their corresponding rates for multi-discount terms. The due date is
the last date specified.

-For terms with a type of <b>“Net Due On”,</b> the due date is the date you specify in
the Net Due On column.

-For term codes with a type of <b>“Next Month”,</b> the due date is always the month
following the voucher date, regardless of the day of the month for the voucher
date. For example, if the due date for the next month-type term is the 10th, then
any voucher you enter in June is due July 10th, and any voucher you enter in
July is due August 10th.

-For terms with a type of <b>“Same Month”,</b> the due date is the same month if the
voucher date is on or before the specified day of that month. If the voucher date
is later than the specified due day, the due date is the following month. For
example, if the specified due day is the 15th, a voucher dated June 14th is due
June 15th, but a voucher dated June 16th is due July 15th.

vouchers with a payment priority of ‘1’ for the vendors whose codes fall between ‘ABC1’ and ‘ASY1’. If
you enter a value in a From field but not a To field, the selected vouchers include those that are ‘greater
than or equal to’ the value you enter in the From field (e.g., all vendors with vendor codes ‘ABC1’ and

The information on the Payment Information tab defaults from the Voucher tab or from previous payment records (with the exception of the Amount to be Paid field). You can use this window to view the status of the voucher. You can review more detail about paid amounts by clicking View Payments. This window also displays specific voucher payment information including payment and discount dates, paid amounts, discount amounts you have taken or lost, and 1099 backup withholding amounts. You can enter an amount to be paid that is less than the total voucher amount then generate payments. This creates a partial payment for a voucher.

vouchers. 

<br><br>
You can enter vouchers manually for direct pay invoices or allow the system to generate
them from receipts related to Purchase Order Line Items. The voucher number is unique
per company and is automatically generated from the defined Next Number format

From the Voucher Summary window, you can view a list of all vouchers. The window lists
each voucher as a one-line record. You can see voucher details by clicking the Edit or View icon. And use the Voucher Detail Summary window to view Voucher Detail lines

#Create new voucher

- From the '**Main Menu**'-> Choose '**Accounting**' -> '**Voucher Summary** '
- Click new icon to open add new Voucher page. <br>![new.png](/.attachments/new-5c6d169e-6aec-49ac-9c08-1bdc430387c9.png =50x)
- In add page, select voucher <b>'Type'</b> from predefined list - Invoice / Credit / Debit
- Enter <b>'ID'</b>, a unique identifier to identify the Voucher, if Auto-ID isn't enabled.

- Select <b>'**Currency**'</b> from the list
- Select the **'PO number'** (if any) that relates to this Voucher. After selecting the PO, you can transfer PO lines and link them to the Voucher by clicking the **'Transfer'** icon next to the purchase order dropdown <br> ![image.png](/.attachments/image-7418ecd3-a559-422c-8459-3cf365c6bc40.png =350x)
  - On Clicking '**Transfer**' PO lines,  a message prompt will ask, "**_Do you wish to add freight or sales tax?_**". Enter appropriate information and click **'OK'**
- Select <b>'Vendor'</b> from the pre-loaded lists
- Navigate to '**Line Items**' tab to  update line item details
- Navigate to '**Payment Information**' tab update payment related information
- Enter all other fields as required
- Click '**Save**' 

On Successful submission, you will be redirected to Voucher edit page to fill in additional information as required. 

#Allocation & Distribution:

In Voucher, Line Items tab

  - **Allocation**: Select ‘Yes’ to allocate a voucher detail line to other voucher detail lines within
the same voucher. The allocation is based on the relative amount of each detail
line and automatically performed when you save the voucher. Accounts
Payable generates allocations for each voucher detail with an allocation flag set
to “Yes” on the detail line of the voucher. You may enter multiple account
distributions for each voucher detail record. The amounts you distribute can be
based upon percentages, units, or a flat amount (rate). You must distribute the
voucher total before you can exit this window. The remaining cost of the
distributed line item displays after you store each distribution record. The
Multiple Distribution flag appears on the detail record if any distribution records
exist.

  - **Distribution**:  Select a detail line that displays “Yes” in the Allocation field. Click the Distribution
button to display all the accounts to which this line was allocated. If you use project
accounts, the voucher detail lines are allocated by project account number. For example,
assume that you have a freight charge for $500 associated with 20 voucher detail lines
that have all been expensed to different GL account numbers. Specify “Yes” in the
Allocation field of the freight detail line. Click Save. On submission, system automatically creates the allocation lines. (In the example used above, Accounts
Payable generates 20 voucher distribution records to the various GL account numbers.)

- **Voiding Vouchers:** Voucher Voids change the status of a voucher from “Open” to” Void.” When you void a
voucher, the program creates a negative line of detail for each detail record of the voucher. 
#Understanding Voucher
- When you partially pay a voucher, Accounts Payable sets the amount paid on the voucher
to zero. This accommodates situations where you have made a partial payment because of
a dispute. Because the amount is set to zero, you cannot inadvertently pay the voucher
balance. 
- The Voucher tab contains a detail section where you can store multiple distribution
lines associated with the main voucher. You cannot exit from the Voucher window without
entering at least one detail record in the bottom half of the window. 
- The extended value of
each detail line accumulates to equal the voucher total amount in the voucher detail section

- If you have allocated the voucher to more than two GL accounts, the
allocation line is flagged as a multi-distribution line with distribution detail
to more than one other detail line

<center> <h1> WF Approval Process</h1> </center>
<div style='text-align: justify; padding:20px'>
CHAMPS workflow supports the development of standard (one-level) or multi-level approval processes and depending on the requirements in each step one or more approvers can be assigned to the processes. <br><Br> There are two types of approval:

- Standard Approval
- Multi-level approval

#Standard Approval 
Standard Approval Process is an automated process that automates how the organization approves documents based on routing. Additionally Purchasing documents will also follow an individual’s management chain based on spending limits. 
>> Also, if an initial state is configured to require approval on any work flow document, it will be approved upon creation. Otherwise, it would not be authorized in any state and therefore non-existent.

Maintenance Documents
- Routing will be organized by Administrative setup.
- Once the document has been approved by any user on any route the documents Status will be set to **'Approved'**.
- If 'All approval required' is selected in WF State, then all users on all routes will need to approve the document.

Purchasing Documents
- Routing will be organized by spending limit, lowest to highest.
- Once the document spending limit has reached, no further approvals are required and the level is approved
- Anyone on the route with rights to approve dollars amounts greater than the current dollars amount approved, may approve the document regardless of routing notification.
- If 'All approval required' is selected in WF State, then all the users on all the routes will need to approve the document regardless of their spending limit.
#Procedure

>>Standard approval process has a feature where you can select more than one approver to approve a record at the same time, based on whoever approve it first, the record will be set to **'Approved'**.

Imagine you have routing groups with two or more approving members with different spending limits. When the doc enters the **"Waiting for Approval"** state, an email notification will be sent to the users in the routing group with the lowest Spending Limit though anyone in the group may approve the document. But the document status will be set to '**Approved**' only when the approver spending limit is greater than the document amount.

- Assign roles to each Approver <FONT COLOR=RED>(B)</FONT>
- [Add Spending limit](/CMMS-User's-Guide/Work-Flow-\(WF\)/WF-Role-Limits) to each role <FONT COLOR=RED>(C)</FONT>. This approval limit will be  applied to all the users who are assigned with this role

- Go to the Purchase Order and Navigate to the WF State (Eg: '**_Approve_**') that requires approval <FONT COLOR=RED>(G)</FONT>
- An automatic email notification will be sent to the approvers on the selected route with the lowest Spending Limit.
- Users with approver privilege can approve the document
  - When the approver with the  spending limit > PO's total cost approves the document, the document status will be set to '**Approved**'. Until then the document will remain in an '**Unapproved**' status. <FONT COLOR=RED>(H)</FONT>
- Once approved, the document can progress to next state as defined in the WF.

CHAMPS CMMS provides pre-defined Document Groups, which are broken down
further into Document Types. System Administrators are permitted to assign as many
Document Types to a Document Group as it takes to correspond with the various types
of documents needed in your working environment.
<br><br>
Document Types window is a master-details window incorporating two sections

- The upper section displays the Document details including Document Group and Category. 
- The lower section displays the Work Flow and Routes associated to the selected document category

</p>
<center> <h1>WF Next and Prior State </h1> </center>
<div style='text-align: justify; padding:20px'>


#Setup Next State
Document progression from one state to the next is determined by the list of possible
Next States to which a document may advance. The Select "Next States" Tab
permits system administrators to select the possible Next State(s) to which this State
may progress, thus connecting states to each other. There may be more than one
possible Next State, however, one must be selected as the default. <br><br>
The default Possible Next State is the one used by the system when a document is
permitted to advance automatically from State to State without user interference. When
there are more than one Possible Next States, with the exception of the Complete
State, users are permitted to advance documents from State to State manually <br><br>

To Setup the Next State, navigate to the WF state's Edit window

- From the **'Bottom Menu'** -> Choose '**Administration**' -> Click '**WF State**'
- Use the '**Work Flow**' filter to select the identified WF which will list down all the WF states associated to the selected WF
- Click on the '**Edit**' icon next to the identified WF State
- Navigate to the **'Next State'** tab
- Click on the **'New'** to select Next State
- Select the **'State'** from the list. This dropdown will list all the available **States** that have not already been assigned as
possible next states
- Check **'Default'** if required. If Set, indicates that this is the **States** to which the document should
normally progress.
- Click **'Save'**

You can repeat the step to add multiple options.

#Setup Prior State

Prior State management is required when defining Work Order and Step workflow.
Work management functions such as Timecard Approval, Work Order Step
Scheduling, Work Order Step Completion, and Work Order Closure all rely on Prior
State setup.<br><br>
Each of these functions will automatically advance the Work Order Step to a state of In
Progress, Scheduled, Complete, or Closed. Prior State setup indicates when a Work
Order Step is eligible to be advanced. If the document is not currently at one of the
defined Prior States the document will not be flagged as invalid on the Timecard entry
window or will not be displayed on the windows that perform scheduling, completion or
closure functions


To Setup the Prior State, navigate to the WF state's Edit window

- From the **'Bottom Menu'** -> Choose '**Administration**' -> Click '**WF State**'
- Use the '**Work Flow**' filter to select the identified WF which will list down all the WF states associated to the selected WF
- Click on the '**Edit**' icon next to the identified WF State
- Navigate to the **'Next State'** tab
- Click on the **'New'** to select Prior State

<center> <h1> Work Flow </h1> </center>
<div style='text-align: justify; padding:20px'>

Workflow defines the valid "States" a document can progress through in order to enforce
application business rules and approval requirements.
<br><Br>
A simple workflow may indicate a document starts at an <b>'In Process'</b> state, is later
<b>'Completed'</b>, and finally <b>'Closed'</b>. Workflow state change rules may demand a document
must be Completed before it can be Closed. An electronic approval may be required
before a document may be considered Complete.

Adding WF to document is a two step process

- **Setup Work Flow** that describes the set of processes which occur in particular order
- **Associate State to the Work Flow** that describes the actions and rules associated to the particular process
 
#Setup Work Flow
- From the **'Bottom Menu'** -> Choose '**Administration**' -> Click '**WF Summary**'
- Click '**New**' to create new work flow 
- Select '**Document Type**' from the predefined list
- Enter '**ID**' for the WF
- Enter the '**Description**' that describes the WF
- Check '**Default Work Flow**' to indicate whether this WF is the default WF for the selected 'Document Type'
- Check '**Route on Creation Only**'
- Enter detailed '**Comment**' or instruction if required
- Click '**Save**'
<center>

![image.png](/.attachments/image-401fd08d-714c-4332-92dd-2318da160a7f.png =800x)
</center>

#Associate WF State
A document’s Work Flow is defined by the States through which it passes and how
each new State is attained

- From the **'Bottom Menu'** -> Choose '**Administration**' -> Click '**WF State**'
- Click '**New**' to create new WF State 
- Select the '**Work Flow**' that was created in the previous step
- Enter the **'ID'** for the WF state
- Enter the '**Description**' that describes the state
- Enter the '**Sequence**', Numeric sequence indicating the order of the state
- Check '**No Edit**'. When checked, all the fields in the document will be un-editable when attaining this state
- Check '**Approval Required**', checkbox indicating whether or not User Approval is required to
advance to the next State.
- Check '**All Approvals Required**', indicates that all the users on the **'Route'** needs to approve the document in order to advance to the next state
- Check '**Maximum State Change Delay**' (in no. of days), Maximum number of days State Change can be delayed past
the required date.
- Check '**Maximum Approval Delay**' (in no. of days), Maximum number of days Approval can be delayed past the
required date
- Check '**Notify Requestor**'. When the Notify Requestor checkbox is selected on a Work Flow State, when a document enters that state, an email is sent to the email address listed on the document or associated with the personnel identified as the Requestor (depending on the document) indicating that the State has been reached. This does not require approvals or the auto-send checkbox to be checked.
- Check '**Notify Trades**'. When the Notify Trades checkbox is selected on a Work Flow State, when a document enters that state, an email is sent to the trades associated to the document (depending on the document) indicating that the State has been reached. This email will be sent even if approvals are not required and it doesn't require Auto-send to be checked.
- Enter '**Action#**' Code, System defined [WF actions code](/CMMS-User's-Guide/Work-Flow-\(WF\)/WF-Action-Codes) that defines the actions the users are designated to perform
- Check '**Auto Send**'. For the WF State that has an approvals route, 'Auto Send' enables "approval buttons" to the users defined on the approval route and sends an automatic email requesting the approval for the document.
- Check '**Close Document**', indicates that the document is closed and no further action needs to be taken
- Check '**Notify on Enter State**', an email notification will be sent to the users on the approval route when the document entering the state
- Enter '**Email Comment**', user defined comment / instruction that will be attached to the email message body whenever the automatic notification emails are triggered
- Click 'Save'

On Successful submission, you will be redirected to WF State's 'Edit' Window where you can,

- [Setup Prior & Next State](/CMMS-User's-Guide/Work-Flow-\(WF\)/WF-Next-and-Prior-State) - Document progression from one state to the next is determined by the defined States
- [Associate WF Routes](/CMMS-User's-Guide/Work-Flow-\(WF\)/WF-Routes) - When a document enters a WF State containing one or more routes, users on the Route(s) will be able to approve or reject for that WF State. 
- [Define WF Rules](/CMMS-User's-Guide/Work-Flow-\(WF\)/WF-Rules)

<center> <h1> WORK ORDER</h1> </center>

<br></br>

A work order is a document that provides all the information about a maintenance task and outlines a process for completing that task. Work orders can include details on who authorized the job, the procedure, who it’s assigned to, timelines, conditions and what is expected.

The following are ways that you can create a work order:

- [Create New Work Order from scratch](/CMMS-User's-Guide/Work-Order-\(WO\)/Work-Order-\(WO\)/Work-Order-\(WO\)-%2D-Functions/Add-Work-Order)
- [Create WO from approved work request](/CMMS-User's-Guide/Work-Order-\(WO\)/Work-Request-\(WR\)/Work-Request-\(WR\)-%2D-Functions/Generate-WO-from-WR)
- [Generate WOs From Due List](/CMMS-User's-Guide/Preventive-Maintenance-\(PM\)/PM-Due-List-%2D-Preventive-Maintenance-Due-List/Generate-WOs)

- [Create WO from Modeling PM](/CMMS-User's-Guide/Preventive-Maintenance-\(PM\)/PM-Task-%2D-Preventive-Maintenance-Task/Model-WO-from-PM-Task)


As you complete work order, key performance indicators can be tracked through
- Mean time between failures (MTBF) Report
- Mean time to repair or replace (MTTR) Report

<center> <h1> WORK ORDER </h1> </center>

<div style='text-align: justify'>
Work Order module features the Workflow which enables users to request, plan, schedule, track, complete, and close work-related activities. 

A rule-based work flow engine and associated approval function supports business rules and document routing definitions for all baseline and user-defined work types. <br><br>The component provides the ability to identify, describe, and classify problems while initiating work requests. These work requests may be generated for any type of work required including service, emergency repairs, quick work, projects, standing work, dispatch work, and the like. The Work Order component provides approval routing, estimated cost reviews, analysis of repair information, resource and work priority schedules, and work order status. 

The Work Order component provides the following functionality:

- A library of standard job templates for routine maintenance activities that may be tasked into Work Orders or modeled into repetitive tasks triggered by frequencies and/or meters. (Repetitive Tasks, Frequencies and Meters are managed in the [PM Module](/CMMS-User's-Guide/Preventive-Maintenance-\(PM\)).)

- Work Orders support an unlimited number of user-defined Work Order types to  match a functional group’s specific work processes.
- Integrated Material Request, Purchase Request and Purchase Order management for Work Order related MRO spares, tools, services, and miscellaneous items.
- Spending approval limits to ensure that a proper review is made prior to Work Order initiation and approval.
- Daily and weekly scheduling based on available resources and work priority. 
- Automatic status update of Work Orders and individual Tasks to allow tracking from initiation to closure.
- A detailed history file on all closed Work Orders and modeling of Work Orders from the Equipment history file into active Work Orders.

A Work Order usually describes the problem, whereas WO Task define the solution and
accumulate their own individual estimated and actual costs. A Work Order may require
multiple WO Tasks to effectively plan, manage, and schedule large repair projects. The
Associated Tasks tab is used to display the WO Tasks currently related to the Work Order and
provide the ability to insert a new Task. <br><br>
In order to fully plan a work activity, the Work Order module provides an option to manage the following information: General Info, Procedure, Trades, Materials, Assets, Cost, Completion, Safety,
Retest, and Schedule<br><br>
Work Order Tasks are used in Timecard entry, Inventory Issues/Returns, and procurement
processes. The Work Order must have at least one Task to be used with these
transactions. It is for this reason CHAMPS Work Order Workflow and  


[Application Configuration](/CMMS-User's-Guide/Application-Configuration) setup allows Work Orders to be created that automatically generate their first

CMMS enables users to request, plan, schedule, track, complete, and close work-related activities.  
<br><Br>
The Work Request component provides the ability to identify, describe, and classify problems while initiating work requests.  These work requests may be generated for any type of work required including service, emergency repairs, quick work, projects, standing work, dispatch work, and the like.  The Work Order component provides approval routing, estimated cost reviews, analysis of repair information, resource and work priority schedules, and work order status.

<p style="border-style: dashed;padding:20px;text-align:center"> 
<b>Go To:</b>  <i>Maintenance -> Work Request List </i>
</p>
<center>  <h1>Work Request</h1> </center>

A Work Request is an optional, preliminary document that may be used to report a problem 
and/or to initiate the process of correcting the problem. Work Requests may be written by 
employees who are not authorized to write Work Orders and, after approval, may be 
converted into any of the Work Order types. Therefore, the Work Request may exist as 
simply a description of a problem and may define such preliminary information as the 
urgency of the request and details identifying the plant entity (equipment, building, location, 
etc.) the request is written against.
<br><br>
When work requests are submitted and approved, work orders are created.
